		<h2>Make sure your browser is up-to-date</h2>
		<p>To get the most out of our products, we recommend keeping your browser up-to-date. Modern browsers typically render pages faster, support richer interactivity, and offer enhanced security to keep your data safe. Plus, knowing that you have a newer browser means we can spend less time squashing bugs and more time improving your experience. We support the following browsers:</p>
		<div class="pictures">
			<div>
				<img src="images/internet-explorer.png" alt="Internet Explorer">
				<a href="#">Internet Explorer</a>
				<p>Version 8+</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="images/mozilla-firefox.png" alt="Mozilla Firefox">
				<a href="#">Mozilla Firefox</a>
				<p>Version 4+</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="images/google-chrome.png" alt="Google Chrome">
				<a href="#">Google Chrome</a>
				<p></p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="images/apple-safari.png" alt="Apple Safari">
				<a href="#">Apple Safari</a>
				<p>Version 5+</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p class="pictures-note"><strong>Please note:</strong> We do not support Internet Explorer 6 or Opera. Please download one of the browsers above to continue using our products without hiccups.</p>
		<h2>Check your internet connection</h2>
		<div class="text-info">
			<div class="col-1">
				<h4>Can you access other major web sites?</h4>
				<p>If you’re having trouble accessing one of our sites, try visiting <a href="#">Google</a>, <a href="#">Yahoo</a>, or <a href="#">Apple</a> before submitting a support request. If these sites fail, you may have a more serious connection issue — try our other connection tips to the right.</p>
				<p>Assuming those major sites show up fine, it’s time to verify whether other people can access our products. To look into that, be sure to visit status.37signals.com or <a href="#">Down For Everyone Or Just Me</a>.</p>
				<p>Just you? The best explaination could be a DNS issue. DNS servers figure out how internet domain names (like 37signals.com) map to server IP addresses. Try switching to <a href="#">Google Public DNS</a> or <a href="#">Open DNS</a> to see if that resolves the issue.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-2">
				<h4>Try another browser</h4>
				<p>Extensions or other software may occasionally corrupt your browser, leading to unexpected behavior. Before making changes to your primary browser, try accessing the internet with another browser like Chrome or Firefox.</p>
				<h4>Check your anti-virus and firewall settings</h4>
				<p>Still having issues no matter which browser you're using? Try disabling your anti-virus software — corrupt or partially-uninstalled software can break your access to the internet. Also try disabling your firewall temporarily to see if that helps.</p>
				<p>If you continue experiencing issues even with anti-virus and firewall disabled, it's time to check your connection to the network.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-3">
				<h4>On Wi-Fi? Make sure you're connected.</h4>
				<p>Wireless hotspots are great, but they're not always reliable. If you're using wi-fi but having connection issues, start by verifying your connection to the base station. Are you connected to the base station you expect or did your computer pick up someone else's signal? Did you enter the correct password?</p>
				<p>If you're on the correct base station and the password checks out, try looking into your signal strength. If it's relatively weak, try moving closer to the hotspot and try accessing the web again.</p>
				<p>Good signal but still having issues? It may be time to restart the base station and try again in a few minutes.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-4">
				<h4>Restart your modem and your router.</h4>
				<p>When all else fails, it's time to check the hardware that connects you to the internet in the first place. If you can access the modem and the router, you'll need to disconnect them from their power source (the power button often just puts them in standby).</p>
				<p>Once you've powered down the modem and router, wait 10-15 seconds, then plug the modem back in, followed by the router. Allow time for both to boot up and connect by watching the activity lights, then try connecting to the internet again on your computer.</p>
